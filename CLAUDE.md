# OSINT Monitor -- Project Directive

## Purpose

This is a predictive intelligence system. Not a news aggregator. Not a dashboard that shows what happened. The point is to figure out **what is going to happen next** based on what is observable right now.

The system collects signals from 40+ open sources across multiple intelligence disciplines -- news, military transponders, sanctions lists, seismic sensors, trade flows, internet censorship, displacement data, nuclear safeguards, vulnerability databases. It extracts structured claims, entities, and relationships. It clusters events, tracks narrative propagation, and detects coordination.

All of that is infrastructure. The actual product is **deduction**: a chain of reasoning from observed facts to predicted outcomes.

## Analytical Philosophy

### Show evidence, not scores

Do not generate fake precision. No "53.1% probability of escalation." No composite severity scores built from made-up weights. These numbers create an illusion of rigor where none exists.

Instead: show what was observed, who reported it, whether sources agree or disagree, and what it means. Let the evidence speak. The analyst -- human or AI -- reasons from the evidence, not from a number.

### Reason like a game theorist

Every actor in a geopolitical situation is making strategic decisions under constraints. To predict what happens next, you must:

1. **Identify the actors** and their interests. Who benefits, who loses, who is constrained.
2. **Map the decision space.** What can each actor actually do? Not what they say -- what their capabilities and constraints permit.
3. **Trace the incentive structure.** Given what Actor A did, what is Actor B's best response? Given B's likely response, what does A anticipate and prepare for?
4. **Find the equilibria.** Where do the incentive chains converge? What outcomes are stable? What outcomes are unstable and likely to shift?
5. **Identify the pivots.** What single variable, if it changed, would shift the equilibrium? That's your leading indicator.

### Chain deductions from truth

Every prediction must trace back to observable facts through a clear logical chain:

```
OBSERVED: Iran has allowed selective tanker transits through Hormuz under apparent coordination (source: @TheIntelFrog, MarineTraffic data)
OBSERVED: EU leaders rejected military involvement in Hormuz (source: Al Jazeera, BBC)
OBSERVED: Trump asking ~7 countries for help reopening Hormuz (source: Defense News)
DEDUCTION: Iran is using selective access as leverage -- allowing allies' ships while blocking others. This is a negotiating position, not a total blockade.
DEDUCTION: EU refusal to participate militarily means the US cannot assemble a coalition for forced reopening without significant unilateral risk.
DEDUCTION: Trump seeking 7 countries' help and being refused means diplomatic pressure is failing.
PREDICTION: The Hormuz situation will persist as a managed crisis rather than resolve quickly. Iran will continue selective access to prevent a unified military response while maintaining economic pressure. Resolution requires either a direct US-Iran negotiation channel or an escalation that forces coalition formation.
```

Every step must be defensible. "Iran is using selective access as leverage" is a deduction from the observed transit patterns. "EU refusal means the US cannot assemble a coalition" follows from the diplomatic record. The prediction follows from the strategic logic.

### Be confident about what you see

When the data is clear, say so directly. Do not hedge with "it appears that" or "it seems possible that" when 12 independent sources confirm something happened. CENTCOM says they struck thousands of targets. Al Jazeera confirms Iran is still launching missiles. Both are confirmed facts from primary sources. State them as facts.

Reserve uncertainty language for actual uncertainty: competing claims, single-source reports, ambiguous signals. The Admiralty system exists for this -- use it. C1 means confirmed. D3 means doubtful. Say which one it is and move on.

### Distinguish between what is known and what is predicted

Three categories, always labeled:

- **CONFIRMED**: Multiple independent sources agree. Observable evidence supports it.
- **ASSESSED**: Logical deduction from confirmed facts. The reasoning chain is explicit.
- **PREDICTED**: Forward-looking judgment based on assessed dynamics. Always includes the key assumptions that, if wrong, would invalidate the prediction.

## When Generating Briefings and Analysis

### Daily briefings should answer three questions:
1. What happened? (Confirmed events, sourced)
2. What does it mean? (Assessment with reasoning chain)
3. What happens next? (Prediction with key assumptions)

### I&W evaluations should not be checklists
Do not just list which keywords appeared in today's news. Ask: given what we know about the actors' capabilities, intentions, and constraints, does the pattern of indicators suggest a trajectory toward the scenario? Or is it noise?

### ACH matrices should drive toward a conclusion
The point of ACH is not to list hypotheses. It is to eliminate hypotheses that are inconsistent with the evidence and identify which remaining hypothesis best explains the full body of evidence. End with a judgment, not a matrix.

### Red Team analysis should be genuinely adversarial
When generating counter-assessments, do not simply list alternative possibilities. Attack the strongest link in the reasoning chain. Find the assumption that, if wrong, collapses the entire assessment. That is the vulnerability.

## Report Archiving

Every time you produce an intelligence analysis, briefing, forecast, or assessment, **archive it** in `reports/YYYY-MM-DD/`. This is mandatory, not optional.

### Report types and filenames

| Type | Filename | When to generate |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Situation Report | `01-situation-report.md` | Any full intelligence assessment. CONFIRMED/ASSESSED/PREDICTED structure. |
| Event Forecast | `02-event-forecast.md` | Any forward-looking analysis. Actor positions, 48h/1-2wk/1-3mo forecasts with key assumptions. |
| Thematic Analysis | `03-thematic-{topic}.md` | Deep dives — game theory synthesis, economic warfare analysis, actor profiles, Jiang-style reasoning. Name the topic. |
| Signal Inventory | `04-signal-inventory.md` | Full dump of what every modality is showing. Pre-narrative signals, financial layer, infrastructure layer, narrative layer. |
| Red Team | `05-red-team.md` | Counter-assessment that attacks the strongest link in the reasoning chain. |
| Flash Report | `flash-{topic}.md` | Breaking events that don't fit the daily cycle. Short, urgent, sourced. |

### Rules

- **One folder per date.** Multiple reports per day are normal — the situation evolves.
- **Always include the source count and modality summary** at the bottom of each report. The reader needs to know what the assessment is built on.
- **Always label CONFIRMED / ASSESSED / PREDICTED.** No unmarked claims.
- **Always state key assumptions for predictions.** The assumption that, if wrong, invalidates the prediction.
- **Include the reasoning chain.** OBSERVED -> DEDUCTION -> PREDICTION. Every step defensible.
- **Do not overwrite previous reports.** If the situation changes, write a new report or a flash update. The archive is a historical record of what was assessed and when.
- **Reference previous reports when updating.** "Updating the 03-17 assessment: the Baghdad secondary front prediction from 02-event-forecast.md has materialized."

### When in doubt, archive

If the user asks for analysis and you produce something substantive — more than a few sentences of commentary — archive it. Err on the side of saving too much rather than too little. The archive is the institutional memory of this system.

## Running the Pipeline

### One-shot (manual run)

```bash
python main.py collect        # Run all sources once, full pipeline
python main.py briefing       # Generate daily intelligence briefing
python main.py alerts         # Check current alerts
python main.py serve          # Start web dashboard (http://localhost:8000)
```

### Continuous / Real-time (daemon mode)

```bash
python main.py daemon         # Start tiered background pipeline
```

The daemon runs three collection tiers at different intervals:

| Tier | Interval | Sources | What it catches |
|------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Hot** | 2.5 min | ADS-B, DNS, currency, commodities, defense stocks, seismic | Pre-narrative signals — military aircraft, infrastructure disruptions, market moves |
| **Warm** | 10 min | RSS feeds (11), Nitter/social (14), GDELT, travel advisories, OONI, flight routes, cables, BGP | News cycle — matches actual source update frequency |
| **Cold** | 60 min | FIRMS, USGS, ACLED, sanctions, NVD, UNHCR, IAEA, Wikipedia, SEC, finance bridge, Congress | Slow-updating datasets — rate-limited or heavy APIs |

Each tier does **delta-only processing**: dedup immediately, NLP/embedding/clustering only on NEW items, fusion re-evaluates after any tier produces new data. The dashboard gets SSE push updates within seconds of new items landing.

Tier intervals are configurable in `config/sources.yaml` under the `tiers:` section.

### On/Off Control

The pipeline can be paused and resumed without killing the daemon process.

**CLI:**
```bash
python main.py pause          # Pause — all tiers skip their ticks
python main.py resume         # Resume — tiers collect on next tick
python main.py status         # Show current state (paused/running, jobs)
```

**API (when `serve` or dashboard is running):**
```
POST /api/daemon/pause        # Pause
POST /api/daemon/resume       # Resume
POST /api/daemon/toggle       # Toggle pause/resume
GET  /api/daemon/status       # Current state + job schedule
```

**File-based (no server needed):**
- Create `data/pause` to pause (any content)
- Delete `data/pause` to resume

All three methods use the same flag file, so they interoperate. Pause from the CLI, resume from the API, check status from either.

### Running dashboard + daemon together

```bash
# Terminal 1: daemon (collects and processes)
python main.py daemon

# Terminal 2: web dashboard (serves UI + API)
python main.py serve
```

The daemon pushes updates to the SSE stream at `/api/stream`, so the dashboard shows new items in near-realtime.

## Technical Notes

- Pipeline: collectors -> dedup -> NLP -> claims -> clustering -> geocoding -> corroboration -> I&W -> alerting -> fusion
- Tiered pipeline: hot (2.5min) / warm (10min) / cold (60min) with delta processing and skip-if-running guards
- Database: SQLite default, PostgreSQL+pgvector for scale
- LLM: OpenAI (gpt-5-mini default) for briefings, ACH, Red Team, I&W relevance scoring
- All scores in the API are kept for programmatic use but the UI shows evidence, not numbers
- Corroboration is pre-cached on Event records during pipeline run for instant dashboard loads
- Finance bridge: runs `finance_agent` (sibling repo) to generate daily macro report, extracts intelligence signals
- Fusion engine: cross-correlates signals across 10 modalities, detects convergence patterns and signal gaps
- Reports archive: `reports/YYYY-MM-DD/` — every analysis archived with date, type, and source inventory
- SSE stream: hybrid push (event bus from tier jobs) + poll (DB check every 15s for alerts/events from other sources)
- Tier assignments: defined in `COLLECTOR_TIERS` dict in `osint_monitor/processors/pipeline.py`
- Pause mechanism: file-based flag at `data/pause`, checked by all tier jobs before running
