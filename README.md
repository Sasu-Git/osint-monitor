# OSINT Monitor

Autonomous geopolitical intelligence collection and analysis platform.

## What It Does

- **Collects** from 42+ open sources across six intelligence disciplines -- RSS feeds, social media, government databases, sanctions lists, ADS-B transponders, seismic sensors, trade flows, and more.
- **Extracts** named entities, claims, and event triples using spaCy NLP and LLM-assisted analysis, then resolves them against a seeded knowledge base with alias matching.
- **Clusters** related reports into discrete events using HDBSCAN over sentence embeddings, deduplicates across sources, and tracks narrative propagation over time.
- **Produces** structured intelligence assessments including daily briefings, Admiralty-scored corroboration matrices, Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH), Indicators and Warnings (I&W) evaluations, and STIX 2.1 exports.

## Quick Start

One environment (`.venv`) for runtime and tests. SQLite, no other services.
`pyproject.toml` is the source of truth for Python dependencies; the spaCy
language model is the only extra download.

```bash
# 1. Environment (Python 3.10+)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate            # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -e ".[all,dev]"
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg

# 2. Configure
cp .env.example .env                 # Windows: copy .env.example .env
# Edit .env -- set OPENAI_API_KEY (or another provider's key) for briefings

# 3. Verify
pytest                               # unit tests
python main.py smoke                 # real pipeline on fixtures, temporary DB, no network/LLM

# 4. Run once
python main.py migrate               # creates / upgrades data/osint.db (backs it up first)
python main.py seed
python main.py collect
python main.py briefing --hours-back 24
python main.py serve                 # http://localhost:8000

# Continuous operation (second terminal next to `serve`)
python main.py daemon
```

The first `smoke` / `collect` downloads the sentence-transformers embedding model
(`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, ~90 MB) into the Hugging Face cache.

Optional scaling only (not needed locally): PostgreSQL and Redis via Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
# Set OSINT_DB_URL=postgresql://osint:osint_dev@localhost:5432/osint_monitor in .env
python main.py migrate
python main.py daemon
```

## Architecture

The processing pipeline runs as a single sequential pass or as scheduled background tasks:

```
Collectors (42+ sources)
    |
    v
Deduplication (content hash + semantic similarity)
    |
    v
Multilingual detection & translation
    |
    v
NLP entity extraction (spaCy NER + custom gazetteers)
    |
    v
Entity resolution (alias matching, coreference, Wikidata linking)
    |
    v
Claim extraction & stance classification
    |
    v
Event clustering (HDBSCAN over sentence-transformer embeddings)
    |
    v
Full-text enrichment (article body fetching)
    |
    v
Relation extraction (subject-predicate-object triples)
    |
    v
Geocoding (location resolution to coordinates)
    |
    v
Corroboration scoring (Admiralty/NATO system)
    |
    v
Indicators & Warnings evaluation
    |
    v
Alerting (desktop, Slack, Discord, email, webhook)
```

The daemon scheduler automates the pipeline on a recurring basis:

| Task           | Interval      |
|----------------|---------------|
| Collection     | Every 15 min  |
| Clustering     | Every 30 min  |
| Analysis       | Every 2 hours |
| Alerts         | Every 15 min  |
| Daily briefing | 06:00 UTC     |

## Intelligence Capabilities

### Entity Resolution with Coreference

Extracts entities via spaCy NER augmented with a custom gazetteer of weapon systems, military organizations, facilities, and key leaders. Resolves aliases (e.g., "Revolutionary Guards" to "IRGC") using fuzzy matching and Wikidata identifiers. Tracks entity mention frequency and first/last seen timestamps.

### Event Clustering with Sub-Event Decomposition

Groups related reports using HDBSCAN clustering over sentence-transformer embeddings. Near-duplicate items from different sources are linked to the same event, enabling multi-source event reconstruction. Clusters are assigned severity scores, event types, and geographic coordinates.

### Admiralty/NATO Corroboration Scoring

Implements the Admiralty (NATO) system for evaluating source reliability and information credibility. Computes corroboration scores based on independent source agreement and detects disagreements between sources reporting on the same event.

### Claim-Level Stance Detection

Extracts discrete claims from reporting and classifies source stance (agree, disagree, neutral) at the claim level rather than the article level. Enables detection of conflicting narratives across sources.

### Indicators and Warnings Framework

Evaluates predefined escalation scenarios against incoming intelligence. Each scenario contains weighted indicators with entity and keyword co-occurrence requirements. Built-in scenarios:

- Iran nuclear breakout (IAEA expulsion, enrichment levels, facility expansion)
- China-Taiwan invasion (amphibious exercises, carrier deployments, embassy evacuations)
- Russia-NATO escalation (nuclear posture, GPS jamming, Article 5, submarine surges)
- Middle East regional war (Hezbollah escalation, Hormuz closure, Houthi activity)

Includes escalation probability estimation with forward-looking threat scoring.

### Structured ACH with Bayesian Updating

Generates Analysis of Competing Hypotheses matrices for events using LLM-assisted hypothesis and evidence generation. Computes posterior probabilities, identifies diagnostic evidence, and exports formatted matrices in JSON or Markdown.

### Knowledge Graph with Community Detection

Builds an entity relationship graph from co-occurrence and extracted relations. Supports community detection (Louvain), centrality scoring (degree, betweenness, eigenvector), broker identification, and ego-graph exploration. Exports in vis.js-compatible format for interactive visualization.

### STIX 2.1 Export

Exports events, entities, and relationships as STIX 2.1 bundles for integration with threat intelligence platforms (MISP, OpenCTI, etc.). Available per-event or as bulk export.

### Narrative Propagation Tracking

Detects how a story propagates across sources over time, identifying origin sources and amplification patterns. Maps the temporal spread of narratives through the media ecosystem.

### Coordination and Influence Detection

Identifies coordinated posting patterns by detecting temporally clustered publications across sources within configurable time windows. Tracks narrative adoption by keyword across sources and maps amplification networks.

## Configuration

### Sources (`config/sources.yaml`)

Defines RSS feeds, Twitter/Nitter accounts, alert keywords, and region focus areas. Each source has a name, URL, category, credibility score (0.0--1.0), priority tier, and poll interval in seconds.

```yaml
rss_feeds:
  - name: "Reuters World"
    url: "https://www.reutersagency.com/feed/..."
    category: "news"
    credibility_score: 0.9
    priority: 1
    poll_interval: 600
```

### Entities (`config/entities.yaml`)

Seeds the entity resolution system with canonical names, types, aliases, and optional Wikidata IDs. Supported types: `PERSON`, `ORG`, `WEAPON_SYSTEM`, `FACILITY`.

```yaml
entities:
  - canonical_name: "IRGC"
    entity_type: "ORG"
    aliases: ["Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps", "Revolutionary Guards"]
    wikidata_id: "Q106482"
```

### Alerts (`config/alerts.yaml`)

Defines compound alert rules that fire when specific entity-keyword pairs co-occur. Supports severity thresholds, cooldown periods, quiet hours, and multiple delivery channels (desktop, Slack, Discord, email, webhook).

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "Iran nuclear escalation"
    type: compound
    conditions:
      entity: "Iran"
      keyword: "nuclear"
    severity: 0.9
    cooldown_minutes: 120
    channels: ["desktop", "slack"]
```

### Indicators and Warnings (`config/indicators.yaml`)

Defines I&W scenarios with weighted indicators. Each indicator specifies keywords and optional entity constraints. When both an entity and keyword co-occur in the same item, the indicator is considered triggered.

```yaml
iran_nuclear_breakout:
  description: "Iran moves toward nuclear weapon capability"
  indicators:
    - name: "IAEA inspector expulsion"
      weight: 0.9

## Scaling

The default configuration uses SQLite and runs everything in-process. For production:

**PostgreSQL + pgvector** -- Switch to PostgreSQL for concurrent access and vector similarity search over embeddings. The provided `docker-compose.yml` starts `pgvector/pgvector:pg16`.

```bash
pip install -e ".[postgres]"
docker compose up -d postgres
# Set OSINT_DB_URL=postgresql://osint:osint_dev@localhost:5432/osint_monitor
```

**Celery + Redis** -- Offload collection and analysis tasks to background workers for parallel execution.

```bash
pip install -e ".[celery]"
docker compose up -d redis
# Set CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
```

**Docker Compose** -- The included `docker-compose.yml` provides PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector and Redis 7.

## CLI Commands

All commands are run via `python main.py <command>` or the installed `osint-monitor` entry point.
